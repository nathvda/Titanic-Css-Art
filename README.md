# Titanic-Css-Art

Welcome to this repository. It was started on December 9th 2022 and I am trying to recreate the Titanic with pure CSS and HTML.

## Why vw ?

I used vw for most of my dimensions so drawing wouldn't get destroyed when upscaling or downscaling the screen. It is still a work in progress, of course.

## Why are the colors off ?

I haven't looked up the proper colors yet. As of today, December 9th, it is still very drafty.

## Icebergs

For the icebergs, I decided to use clip-path property, but it is very time consuming.

## Compatibility

As of now, I have tested it on Chrome and Firefox, and both work quite well.
