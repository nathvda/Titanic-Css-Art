# Titanic-Css-Art

Welcome to this repository. It was started on December 9th 2022 and I am trying to recreate the Titanic with pure CSS and HTML.

## Why vw ? 
I used vw for most of my dimensions so drawing wouldn't get destroyed when upscaling or downscaling the screen. It is still a work in progress, of course.

## Why are the colors off ? 
I haven't looked up the proper colors yet. As of today, December 9th, it is still very drafty.

- Added the first forms and colors.
- Added a few simple details.
- Worked on responsiveness.
